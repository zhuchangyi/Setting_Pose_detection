# Setting_Pose_detection
This project is an implementation of MoveNet which is developed by Google. Inspired by monolesan's fix_posture projected,we are going to set more thresholds and use the deep-learning to make it better to use or worse, lol! 
# Things on going:
I am still testing the thresholds to make better results
The deep learning way will be employed after the thresholds are all setting well, I am going to lead users to set up their own model which is at the end of the MoveNet,due to the different device and working environment.
